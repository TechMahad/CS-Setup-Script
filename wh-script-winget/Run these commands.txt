Note: This script uses winget to install applications, so you don't need a USB drive with installers.
Make sure you have an internet connection for winget to download and install the applications.

If winget is not installed, you can install it from the Microsoft Store by searching for "App Installer".

Printer Drivers:
- Place printer drivers in: Installers\PrinterDrivers (relative to this script)
- The script will automatically copy them to the desktop if found.
- Printer drivers are hardware-specific and cannot be installed via winget.
- If you don't have printer drivers, the script will continue without them.
